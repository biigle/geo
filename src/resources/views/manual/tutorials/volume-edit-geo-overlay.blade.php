        Geo overlays are geo-referenced layers that can be used on maps.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the geo overlays panel, overlays can be created by uploading geoTIFF-files or linking web-map-services (WMS) via URL's.
        The panel is located in the Volume Edit View (Click the <button class="btn btn-default btn-xs" title="Edit"><i class="fa fa-pencil-alt"></i></button>-button in the Volume Overview to get there). To view the available upload mechanisms in the geo overlays panel, click the <button class="btn btn-default btn-xs"><i class="fa fa-plus"></i></button>-button in the top-right corner of the panel.
    </p>
    <h3>GeoTIFF</h3>
    <p>
        The first option to upload an overlay is to provide a geoTIFF-file (in .tif format). The upload allows only GeoTIFF's that have projected coordinate reference systems (CRS) and use the common <a href="https://epsg.org/home.html" target="_blank">EPSG Geodetic Parameter Dataset</a> codes (e.g. EPSG:4326 for WGS84 CRS). It does, however, not support user-defined projected CRS.
    </p>
    <h3>Web Map Service (WMS)</h3>
    <p>
        The second option to embed an overlay is by providing the URL to a WMS source. If only the base URL of the WMS is provided (e.g. <code>https://maps.org/geoserver/namespace/wms</code>), the first layer of the WMS will be chosen as the overlay. By providing a URL with query parameters (e.g. <code>https://maps.org/geoserver/namespace/wms?service=WMS&version=1.1.0&request=GetMap&layers=LAYER1,LAYER5</code>), it is also possible to specify WHICH layer(s) of the WMS shall be used. The uploaded overlay will contain ALL the layers specified in the layers-parameter of the URL.
    </p>
    <h3>Overlay Usage</h3>
    <p>
        There are two possibilities to use the overlays within the Volume. The usage can be determined by enabling / disabling the "Browsing" and "Context" buttons within the list of overlays (individually for each uploaded overlay):
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            An enabled "Browsing"-button will display the overlay on the map-modal of the geo-selection filter (Click the <button class="btn btn-default btn-xs"><i class="fa fa-filter"></i></button>-button in the Volume Overview and choose "geo-selection" from the list of filters to get there).
        </li>
        <li>
            An enabled "Context"-button makes the overlay available as a context-layer / background-layer in the Annotation-View of Biigle. 
        </li>
    </ol>
    <div class="panel panel-info">
        <div class="panel-body">
            <p>
                It is also possible to sort the overlays according to the order they should appear on the map (top to bottom = highest to lowest layer) by dragging an overlay from the list with the <button class="btn btn-default btn-xs"><i class="fas fa-grip-lines"></i></button>-button to the desired position.
